# Quantitative Proteomics Analysis Using R and Bioconductor

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive analytical pipeline for quantitative proteomics data analysis using R and Bioconductor. The study particularly evaluates the impact of various statistical methodologies on protein expression analysis, leveraging data from a Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) 6-plex experiment with spiked proteins in an *Erwinia carotovora* lysate.

## Objectives

- To analyze and compare different normalization techniques and their effects on protein intensity and clustering patterns.
- To explore various statistical methodologies to understand their impact on quantitative proteomics data interpretation.
- To contribute to advancements in personalized medicine and disease research by enhancing the understanding of methodological choices in quantitative proteomics.

## Key Technologies

- **R**: For statistical computing and data analysis.
- **Bioconductor**: A software project providing tools for analyzing genomic data.
- **MSnbase**: An R package for mass spectrometry data manipulation and visualization.
- **RforProteomics**: Tools and workflows for proteomics data analysis in R.
- **mzTab/mzXML**: Data formats used for storing proteomics data.
- **TMT 6-plex**: A method for protein quantification across different samples.
- **Data Imputation, MAplot, Heatmaps**: Techniques for data normalization, visualization, and analysis.

## Data Description

The dataset analyzed in this project was sourced from the PRIDE database (PXD000001) and involved a TMT 6-plex experiment where four exogenous proteins (ENO, BSA, PHO, CYT) were spiked into an *Erwinia carotovora* lysate. The experiment aimed to explore how different analytical methodologies affect the interpretation of protein expression data.

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Retrieved data from PRIDE database using the `rpx` package.
   - Processed mzTab and mzXML files for subsequent analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Applied quality control and filtering to remove missing values.
   - Implemented data normalization using sum, vsn, median, and quantile methods.
   - Conducted data imputation to ensure robustness in statistical analysis.

3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Compared protein intensity calculation methods (sum vs. mean).
   - Evaluated different normalization techniques on clustering patterns.
   - Visualized data through MAplots, heatmaps, and spike plots.

4. **Results Interpretation**:
   - Analyzed the impact of analytical methodologies on protein expression profiles.
   - Identified how different methodological choices influence the outcomes in quantitative proteomics.

## Visualizations

- **MAplots**: Visualized protein intensity differences across conditions.
- **Heatmaps**: Explored the impact of normalization techniques on protein clustering.
- **Spike Plots**: Compared normalized intensity across different proteins.

## Key Findings

- The choice of normalization method significantly influences protein intensity and clustering patterns.
- Statistical methodologies, such as sum vs. mean for protein intensity calculation, result in different interpretations of protein expression data.
- Normalization methods, like vsn and quantile, reveal distinct clustering patterns, underscoring the importance of careful methodological selection.

## Future Work

- Explore additional datasets to validate findings across different biological conditions.
- Investigate the integration of machine learning methods for enhanced data analysis.
- Further study the impact of normalization and imputation techniques on proteomics data interpretation.

## Reflection

This project has provided valuable insights into the complexities of proteomics data analysis and the critical role of methodological choices in influencing outcomes. The skills developed in R programming, data analysis, and the use of Bioconductor packages will be essential for future research in personalized medicine and disease understanding.
